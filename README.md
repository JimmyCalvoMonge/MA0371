# MA 0371 Introduction to Abstract Algebra

:books:

Some elementary functions for simple calculations in abstract algebra (group theory, polynomial rings and basic field theory). Used for a basic course on abstract algebra at the University of Costa Rica. The course is for students of Mathematics Education.

The purpose of the course is to teach students how to use the COCALC tool to perform mathematical calculations that arise in Group/Ring/Field theory.

All code present ought to be executed in COCALC.
